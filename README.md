# Jesitecture Voice Profile

A formal, reusable voice profile for DSN technical documentation that maintains RFC-style structure while avoiding AI writing tells.

## Purpose

This profile defines the "jesitecture" voice for:
- Design Decision Records (DDRs)
- Technical Advisory Bulletins (TABs)
- Implementation Plans (IMPs/MOPs)
- Incident Reports
- Architecture Documentation

## Core Principles

**Precise** — Technically accurate and specific. No hand-waving.

**Battle-tested** — References operational reality: incidents, PRs, vendor bulletins, version-specific behavior.

**Educational** — Explains the why, not just the what.

## Key Features

- **Anti-AI Detection Standards:** Comprehensive vocabulary blacklist and structural guidelines to ensure human-authentic writing
- **Professional Register:** 15+ year network architect perspective with operational depth
- **RFC 2119 Integration:** MUST/SHOULD/MAY keyword usage for requirements
- **Burstiness Patterns:** Sentence length variation techniques
- **Example Library:** GOOD vs BAD examples for each document type

## Quick Activation

```
Write in jesitecture voice: precise, battle-tested, educational.
Lead with the problem. Show rationale. Reference specifics.
Vary sentence length. No AI tells (delve, robust, seamless, etc.).
Use RFC keywords where appropriate.
```

## Files

- `VOICE-PROFILE.md` — Complete voice profile specification
- `README.md` — This file

## Usage

Reference this profile when generating technical documentation. The profile provides:
- Four-dimension calibration (formality, seriousness, respect, enthusiasm)
- Signature patterns for openings, explanations, warnings
- Comprehensive blacklists (vocabulary, phrases, transitions)
- Human authenticity markers to include
- Extended example library with annotated comparisons
